## Hi, I'm Bayan Taqi 👋

🔭 About Me
I am a 3rd-year Honours Physics & Astronomy student at York University with a passion for using computational methods to solve complex, real-world problems. My academic background has trained me to handle high-volume, "noisy" datasets and transform them into clear, actionable insights through numerical modeling.

🛠 Technical Toolbox

Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), VBA (Excel Automation), SQL (Basic), MATLAB
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs), Tableau.
Methodologies: Data Reduction, Statistical Modeling, Error Analysis, and Signal Processing.


🧪 Featured Projects

Astronomy Data Reduction: Developed Python pipelines in Jupyter Notebooks to clean raw observational data and perform statistical validation on complex trends.


Planetary System Simulation: Built numerical models to simulate multi-body gravitational interactions and solve differential equations with high precision

💼 What I Bring to the Table
I combine the analytical rigor of a physicist with the communication skills of a professional tutor and sales associate. I am adept at translating technical findings into accessible reports and am comfortable working under the pressure of time-sensitive deadlines.
