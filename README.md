# Hi, I'm Bayan Taqi 👋

### 🔭 About Me
I am a 3rd-year **Honours Physics & Astronomy student at York University** with a focus on computational methods and data reduction. I specialize in transforming raw, complex datasets into actionable insights using analytical rigor and numerical modeling.

### 🛠 Technical Toolbox
* **Languages:** Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas), VBA (Excel Automation), SQL (Basic), MATLAB.
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub, Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUPs), Tableau.
* **Methodologies:** Data Reduction, Statistical Modeling, Error Analysis, and Signal Processing.

### 🧪 Featured Projects
* **Astronomy Data Reduction:** Developed Python pipelines in **Jupyter Notebooks** to clean raw observational data and perform statistical validation on complex trends.
* **Planetary System Simulation (PHYS 2030):** Built numerical models to simulate multi-body gravitational interactions and solve differential equations with high precision.

### 💼 Professional Skills
I combine technical proficiency with strong **communication skills** gained through my experience in tutoring and professional sales. I am adept at translating technical findings into accessible reports for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
